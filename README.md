This beautiful landing page was a redesign for a current mid-mountain restaurant at the Aspen, CO ski resort. Site features the use of bootstrap, CSS3 and plain JavaScript to add lovely effects such as
a parallax section and a modal. Font Awesome and Google Fonts were also used. Site was an individual project and is hosted on Netlify. Original site [HERE](https://www.aspensnowmass.com/visit/dining/aspen-highlands/cloud-nine-alpine-bistro)
